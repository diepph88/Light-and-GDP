Hi Paul and Weijia,

Thank you all for attending the meeting on Monday. We covered some important items and helped me to work more effectively with our project.

During the meeting, we discussed the big picture of our project. Paul and Weijia help me to be clearer about the purpose of the project. Here are more detailed on these discussions:

·       I sent some questions related to the project a day before the meeting. From my opinion, I think that it is virtually impossible and unnecessary to develop the conceptual framework because it is so complicated.

·       Paul explained the whole idea of the project: From literature, there are various approaches which are used to explain the difference between light and GDP (residual). Each of these approaches has looked at a small aspect such as: institutional quality, light consumptions, agriculture etc…However, they are highly unstructured and thus makes it rather difficult to see the whole picture. Therefore, our project aims to fill this gap. We first develop a conceptual framework (generalise residual). Then, we will use this framework as a road map to discover many hidden dimensional factors that might explain the residual (guide us to find data). This approach will be much more structured than previous approaches (our main motivation and contribution)

·       Another motivation of this project: we do not have GDP data at subnational level, but we have light data at subnational level. So, if we know the mechanism of how GDP components generate light, we can estimate GDP at subnational level.

·       At the first stage of this project, we will begin with how each GDP component generates light (As Paul said “mechanical way”). It is clear that different sectors of GDP will emit light in different ways. Therefore, when we detect the way statistical agents calculate GDP in detail, we will learn the mechanism of light emission.  

·       Paul suggested that I should upload a summary of every relevant paper related to this project (to write literature review) to GitHub.

·       Weijia helped me to summarise our discussion and suggested some good advice for me to improve English.

·       Paul said that in order to work in the research field, I have to learn how to work independently.

·       My task in Thursday’s presentation: Explore how statistical agents calculate GDP (Expenditure method, Production method and Income method)  

 

Our next meeting will be August 17, which will include updates on projects assigned in this meeting.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration

Best regards,

Diep
