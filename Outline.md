This is a first, high-level sketch of the research plan.

# 1. Main Goal

Identify the factors that determine the difference between official GDP and nighttime light at the subnational level.

# 2. Conceptual framework

- Define difference by u in ln(GDP)_{ic} = \alpha + \beta ln(light)_{ic} + u_ic
