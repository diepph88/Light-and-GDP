This is a first, high-level sketch of the research plan.

# 1. Main Goal

Identify the factors that determine the difference between official GDP and nighttime light at the subnational level.

# 2. Conceptual framework

- Define difference by u in ln(GDP)_{ic} = \alpha + \beta ln(light)_{ic} + u_ic

- Access ABS (Australian Bureau of Statistics), World Bank, IMF or any other public resources to find out how GDP numbers are created (What is in the data and how is it collected)

- List the various components along the main GDP components, C, I, and G

- Identify which components of the actual GDP data in C, I, and G, actually emit nighttime light.


# 3. Compile Subnational data

- PR has subnational light data matched with Shleifer et al (JEG 2014) GDP data.

- Combine with other cross-sectional data (geograph, climate, instituional quality etc.)


# 4. Empirical Analysis

- The empirical task can be considered as a high-dimensional task. We have many explanatory variables, no straightforward theoretical framework to help us reduce the number of potential regressors.

- Apply statistical learning tools (e.g. LASOO, regression trees etc.) to identify determinants.
