# Light and GDP
The goal of this project is to apply modern statistical learning tools such as Lasso, Machine learning, etc to discover which factors determine the differences in nighttime lights (NTL) and GDP data at subnational level. In addition, this project aims to find and add further variables that might explain the subnational difference.  

Recently, several researches have indicated that NTL data are a good proxy measure for economic activities around the world. One of the most advantage of night light data (NTL) is that it is not subjected to human manipulation whereby GDP data suffers from this issue. Furthermore, people can use NLT data uniformly across countries or across subnational regions or across the world. However, there is still a level of uncertainty about the robustness of NTL in measuring economic activity. For example, NTL data is very bad at picking up lower bound or upper bound problems, causing an underestimate of the development level of a region, especially in the booming metropolis of most developed countries or rural areas of developing African countries. In some areas, NTL data can be better or worse measure for economic activities. Therefore, the project would allow us to discover hidden dimensional problems which lead to the gap between GDP official data and NTL data at subnational level.
