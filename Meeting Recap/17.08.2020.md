Hi Paul and Weijia,
Thanh you for attending the meeting this morning. The details of our discussion are listed below:
-	We discussed how our project will be processed. To be more specific:
    Step 1: I will select some developed countries such as US, Australia, European, etc and some developing countries like (China, Vietnam, Brazil) and see how these countries collect data and calculate GDP number. 
    Step 2: I will go through IMF and WB materials to see how these organizations make GDP data between different countries more comparable. What methods they used to construct GDP number for all countries?
    Step 3: Write a report to provide a general description of how GDP is calculated? And which sources of GDP component emit light? 
-	Now, I am going to begin with reading materials from US statistical Bureau (BEA) (attached file). Also, I am learning R from the book “A book of R”
-	Paul shared with me the book “An introduction to Statistical learning” (This is the main R book we will use in this project)
-	Paul shared with me some experience to adapt PhD life during harsh time (pandemic). 
Our next meeting will be 24th, August.

Thank you for your time and considerations. 

Best regards,
Diep
